# Uber Data Analytics | NYC Yellow Taxi
## Decription

- This project involves analyzing a sample of NYC Yellow Taxi trip data from May 2022. The project focuses on data engineering tasks, including the creation of a comprehensive fact table and the integration of various dimension keys. The data pipeline was constructed using Mage AI to extract, transform, and load (ETL) the data into BigQuery. The final step involved visualizing the processed data using Looker Studio.
